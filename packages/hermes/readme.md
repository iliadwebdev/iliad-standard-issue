# Hermes

Standardizes APIs and responses between `fetch` and `axios` for projects where both are necessary.
Responses are modeled after golangs `result, err = whatever()`, because I think that's pretty neat. It's also very explicit, which is good because I find 90% of error-handling headaches come from network requests.
