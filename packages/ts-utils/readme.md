# TS Utils

Provides utility types + utility functions. To import the utility types into your global scope, add the following to your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
  "include": ["node_modules/@iliad.dev/ts-utils"]
```

Do not try to import these types directly into a react app, I guess they don't like .d.ts files.
